This mod adds a new weapon, the Light Sword, wich is a 4th tier sword, it has the same stats as the Fusion Blade, but this one does extra shred and pierces armor.
The mod its WIP, right now its using the Fusion Blade material so it has a glow, but the hilt texture isnt very good. A new material its being worked on.

The mod adds the sword to a savegame, just enable the mod and you will be able to equip the sword. There is no need to investigate it or buy it, its added by default.
To disable it, disabling it from xcom mods its enough.
